Based on the principle of granting only the minimum permissions needed to complete the task, it is recommended to provide only the "s3:GetObject" permissions for the task. 
This means that the user will only have read access to the necessary resources and will not be able to make any changes or manipulate.
However, if additional permissions are required to complete the task, careful consideration needs to be given and documented as to what permissions are needed and why. 
This will help ensure that permissions are granted only when necessary and maintain the overall security of the system. 
"iam_policy_all_permissions.json" provides all permissions, but I don't think that's secure enough.
